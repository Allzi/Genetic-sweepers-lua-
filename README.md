# Genetic sweepers (lua)
An old little project, poor bots try to fill space and are bad at it :/

Written with lua and an OLD version of LÃ¶ve 2D.
This was an personal project, back in year 2012 or 2013.

Bots with a self-made (and bad) genetic algorithm try to visit as many tiles as possible in a time limit.

Check the png file, it tells everything.
